# CIV III Project Space
 VR application submission for UMKC's 2022 Hackathon
 
 All of our code is in the form of C# scripts which were attached to gameobjects in Unity. [Those scripts are found here.](https://github.com/jfordnull/CIV-III-Project-Space/tree/main/Project%20Space%204.1/Assets/Scripts) 
 
 This project relies on packages from the Unity Registry: XR Plugin Management, Oculus XR Plugin, and the XR Interaction Toolkit (we're using v2.0.3). You'll see, for example, that XRGrabInteractableCustom.cs inherits from the XRIT's XRGrabInteractable class.
 
 All assets were hand-modeled and textured by the team, with a few exceptions:
 * The planets in the scene came from a [free asset package.](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/planets-of-the-solar-system-3d-90219) 
 * The nebula skybox is a [paid asset](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/sky/8k-nebulas-10-maps-65403) we optimized/compressed.
 * While the material/texture for the player's hands was created by us, the hand models are from the [Oculus developer website.](https://developer.oculus.com/downloads/package/oculus-hand-models/)
 
 We recommended opening this project in Unity to see for yourself how the gameobjects interact in our scene.
